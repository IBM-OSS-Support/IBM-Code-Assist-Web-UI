> What is java?

#### _Assistant_

> Java is a high-level programming language that is class-based. It was developed by Sun Microsystems in the mid-1990s and has since become one of the most popular programming languages in the world. Java is known for its platform independence, which means that code written in Java can run on any computer that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed.
