> What is java?

#### _Assistant_

> Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It's a general-purpose language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.
> 
> Key features of Java include:
> 
> 1. Platform Independence: Java programs are not written to run on any specific hardware or operating system, but rather on a virtual machine.
>   
> 2. Object-Oriented: It follows the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
> 
> 3. Robustness: The language is designed to be robust, with features that help detect errors at compile time.
> 
> 4. Secure: Java's security model includes built-in protections against certain types of malicious code.
> 
> 5. Multithreaded: It supports multithreading, which allows for the execution of multiple threads concurrently within a single program.
> 
> Java is widely used in Android app development, web applications (using frameworks like Spring), enterprise software, and big data technologies.
